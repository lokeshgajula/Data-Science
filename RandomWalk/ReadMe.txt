Random Walk.

It is intersting to see how random things work, like the path took by an eagle throughout its life or the path a pollen grain takes if it drops into a lake.
To demonstrate how it looks like , i thought of plotting it using matplotlib with some random path points(50000 points).
appropreate coloring and decoration are added.
