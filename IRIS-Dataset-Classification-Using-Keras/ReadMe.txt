In ths project , we solve the classis IRIS Dataset classification using keras API.

Dataset:
Imagine you are a botanist seeking an automated way to categorize each Iris flower you find. 
Machine learning provides many algorithms to classify flowers statistically. For instance, 
a sophisticated machine learning program could classify flowers based on photographs. 
Our ambitions are more modestâ€”we're going to classify Iris flowers based on the length and width measurements of their sepals and petals.

The Iris genus entails about 300 species, but our program will only classify the following three:

Iris setosa
Iris virginica
Iris versicolor
